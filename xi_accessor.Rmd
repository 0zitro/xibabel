# The Xi accessor

This is the `xi` accessor, with which we can add behavior to all DataArrays, including Xibabel images.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import xarray as xr

import nibabel as nib
import xibabel as xib

# For test images.
from xibabel import testing
```

Make sure we have the minimal test data.

```{python}
# Get the data
testing.get_set('minimal')
```

```{python}
ximg = xib.load(testing.JC_EG_ANAT)
ximg
```

The `xi` accessor:

```{python}
ximg.xi.get_affines()
```
