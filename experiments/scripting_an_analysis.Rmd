# Scripting an analysis

```{python}
import xibabel as xi
```

Make sure you have the data with:

```bash
datalad install ///labs/haxby/life
```

You should now have a new directory called `life`

```{python}
ds = xibabel.load_study('life')
```

As a first pass, we might like to run diagnostics on this dataset.



```{python}
# The 
assert len(ds.studies) == 1
study = ds.studies[list(ds.studies)[0])
```

```{python}
for subj_label, subject in study.subjects.items():
    # Each `func` will be an FMRI "run" (time-series of 3D volumes).
    for func_label, func in subject.functionals.items():
        # Create diagnostic time-series and images.  Store in
        # their own dataset.  What is this structure though?
        # Who / what knows about it?  How and where should it be stored?
        diagnostics = xi.diagnostics(func)
        # How should we override and extend the outlier detection?
        # Say outliers is a sparse 2D array size n_volumes by n_slices, with
        # weight 0 through 1 indicating probability of being outlier.
        outliers = diagnostics.find_outliers()
        cleaned_func = xi.remove_outliers(func, outliers, threshold=0.5)
```
