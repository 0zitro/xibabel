# Scripting an analysis

```{python}
import xibabel as xi
```

Make sure you have the data with:

```bash
cd ../testing
datalad install datalad install https://datasets.datalad.org/openneuro/ds003466
datalad get ds003466/sub-007

```

You should now have a new directory called `life`

```{bash}
cd ../testing
datalad install https://datasets.datalad.org/openneuro/ds003466
datalad get ds003466/sub-007
echo "Done"
```

```{python}
from importlib import reload
reload(xi)

d = xi.load('../testing/ds003466/sub-007/ses-01/func/sub-007_ses-01_task-motor_run-01_bold.nii.gz', format="bard")
d
```

```{python}
study = xi.load_study('../testing/life')
study
```

```{python}
study.subjects
```

As a first pass, we might like to run diagnostics on this dataset.



```{python}
# Took this out for now -pi
#assert len(ds.studies) == 1
#study = ds.studies[list(ds.studies)[0])
```

```{python}
for subj_label, subject in study.subjects.items():
    # Each `func` will be an FMRI "run" (time-series of 3D volumes).
    for func_label, func in subject.functionals.items():
        # Create diagnostic time-series and images.  Store in
        # their own dataset.  What is this structure though?
        # Who / what knows about it?  How and where should it be stored?
        diagnostics = xi.diagnostics(func)
        # How should we override and extend the outlier detection?
        # Say outliers is a sparse 2D array size n_volumes by n_slices, with
        # weight 0 through 1 indicating probability of being outlier.
        outliers = diagnostics.find_outliers()
        cleaned_func = xi.remove_outliers(func, outliers, threshold=0.5)
        # store in derivatives/xibabel/?
```
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for (n,d) in outliers.items():
    if d.ndim == 1:
        plt.plot(d, label=n)
plt.legend()
```

```{python}
outliers.keys()
```
